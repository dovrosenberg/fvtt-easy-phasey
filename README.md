Foundry VTT module to support phased maps

[![Supported Foundry Versions](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://foundryshields.com/version?url=https://github.com/dovrosenberg/fvtt-easy-phasey/raw/main/module.json)](https://github.com/dovrosenberg/fvtt-easy-phasey)

Easy Phasey allows you to quickly setup phased maps in Foundry - maps that change over the course of the battle.  Why not just use different scenes?  Because switching scenes requires you to then reset a bunch of other things like tokens, fog of war, etc.  This module handles all that for you.

You just create a folder with the scenes you want to use for the phases, and then use the module to setup the order.  You can then move through the scenes (forward and back) with the click of a button.  Easy Phasey.

Why phased maps?  If you're reading this you probably already know, but there are a variety of use cases for phased maps: 
- Battles that change over time to put pressure on the characters (rising water, lava changing patterns, walls closing in)
- Transition a map between times of day, weather, etc.
- Probably others I can't think of at the moment

## Languages

English, French, and German currently supported.  Let me know if you want others.  PRs also welcome for either new languages or fixes to bad translations in the current ones.  

## Support
I'm happy to do this for free, as I primarily work on things I like to use myself.  But if you'd like to [buy me a root beer](https://ko-fi.com/phloro), I love knowing that people are using my projects and like them enough to make the effort. It's really appreciated!  

## Credits
ChatGPT was used to speed up the development process, as well as to do the language translations.
